= Does SScribe support Arabic and RTL languages? =

Yes. SScribe provides complete RTL (right-to-left) support for Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, Urdu, and other RTL languages. When used with WPML and an RTL-compatible theme, exported DOCX files preserve proper text direction and Arabic font rendering in Microsoft Word and compatible editors.

= Which export formats are available? =

SScribe exports to four formats: Microsoft Word (DOCX), PDF, HTML, and Markdown. You can export in any single format or all four formats simultaneously in one operation.

= Which SEO plugins are supported? =

SScribe reads metadata from Yoast SEO, Rank Math, All in One SEO (versions 3 and 4), SEOPress, and The SEO Framework. If multiple SEO plugins are active, SScribe uses a priority order and labels the source in exported documents.

= Can I export pages from Elementor, Divi, or other page builders? =

Yes. SScribe works with all page builders including Elementor, Divi, WPBakery, Beaver Builder, and Gutenberg. Content is extracted cleanly from any editor.

= How does batch processing work? =

SScribe processes pages in small batches (configurable) to prevent PHP timeouts. This allows exports of hundreds or thousands of pages even on shared hosting with limited execution time.

= Are exported files secure? =

Generated files are stored in a protected directory within wp-content/uploads and bundled into a ZIP file. Files auto-delete after 1 hour for security. Only authenticated WordPress administrators can access exports.

= Can I export all languages at once? =

Yes. With WPML active, choose "All Languages" to export pages from every language in a single operation, or export languages separately for organized workflows.

= Does SScribe work on shared hosting? =

Yes. Our batch processing system is designed for shared hosting environments. Default settings work on hosts with 30-second PHP execution limits.

= Will SScribe slow down my site? =

No. The export process runs only when manually triggered from the admin area. SScribe has zero impact on front-end performance. No cron jobs or background processes run during normal site operation.

= Can developers customize SScribe? =

Yes. SScribe provides extensive hooks and filters for customization. Use `sscribe_page_data` to modify exported data, `sscribe_batch_size` to tune performance, and `sscribe_export_capability` to control permissions. The codebase follows WordPress coding standards and includes comprehensive documentation.

= What's included in each exported document? =

Each document includes: cover page with title/URL/date/breadcrumbs, featured image, page info table (author, dates, word count, reading time), SEO metadata section, full content with formatted headings/tables/lists/blockquotes/code blocks, smart links with visible URLs, button blocks, and child pages list.
